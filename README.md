dbt Analytics Project (PostgreSQL)
### Overview

This project demonstrates how to use dbt (data build tool) to transform raw operational data into analytics-ready tables using a layered modeling approach.
The project is developed locally using dbt Core, PostgreSQL, and VS Code.

It follows common analytics engineering best practices, including:

- source definitions

- staging, intermediate, and mart layers

- tests and seeds

- version-controlled transformations
